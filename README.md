# ActivityMonitor Add-on for Vaadin 8

ActivityMonitor is a UI extension add-on for Vaadin 8 that tracks whether or not a user is active on the app or not. Provides two timers by default - "idle" and "inactive". When the user touches the keyboard, mouse or touchscreen, they are considered active. After they haven't interacted with the application for some time, the server is notified of this. By default, the server gets notified that the client is "idle" after 30 seconds. After 60 seconds, the client is considered "inactive". As soon as the user interacts with the application again, the server is notified that they are "active".
Additional timers with custom timeouts can be added.

This state information can be used to throttle or kick inactive user sessions in order to save on resources.
